#### Description  
##### About the CS50x course
  A graduation project from [Harvard Online CS50x course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/). The course starts with a traditional but omnipresent language **C** that underlies today’s newer languages. The course then transitions to **Python**, a higher-level language that the learner will understand all the more because of **C**. Toward term’s end, the course introduces **SQL**, via which the learner can store data in databases, along with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, via which the learner can create web and mobile apps alike. Course culminates in a **final project**.
  
##### About the project
  The project is called "You are a marathoner!". This is a crisp web app build with **Python**, **Flask**, **Jinja**, **HTML**, **CSS** and a portion of **Javascript**. This is a simple but effective application which helps you to track your runs. Especially if you are having a marathon in mind. It helps you to compare your 4 week results with a database of actual marathoners (based on a dataset kindly provided by [Andrea Girardi at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/girardi69/marathon-time-predictions)).
